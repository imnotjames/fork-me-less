# Github Fork Ribbon in LESS/CSS

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imnotjames/fork-me-less/master/example.png)

## Usage

The default ribbon is pretty basic - an anchor inside of a `fork-me` classed
div.

```html
<div class="fork-me">
	<a href="https://github.com/imnotjames/fork-me-less">
		Fork me on Github
	</a>
</div>
```

There are alternate colors and positions available as well.

#### Colors

The ribbon has a default gray-ish color.  The alternate colors are those you'll
find for the standard github ribbons.

* `green`
* `dark-blue`
* `orange`
* `red`
* `white`

#### Positions

By default the ribbon is on the top right.  However, alternate positions are
available.

* `top-left`
* `top-right`
* `bottom-left`
* `bottom-right`

There also is a class for a fixed position ribbon.

* `fixed`
